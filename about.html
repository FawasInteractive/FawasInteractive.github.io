                <h3><strong><u>Fawas Interactive</u></strong></h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Fawas Interactive first made its entry into the game industry to fulfill the creative itch of an avid gamer, with the goal of creating various amounts of fun and unique experiences.</p>
                <p>Beginning in 2017 (under the former name: FawaStudios), a large amount of nearly lost-to-time projects were created, some bad, and some downright horrible. However, amidst that steaming pile of garbage came some very valuable lessons and a lot of experience.</p>
                <p>Flashing forward, Fawas Interactive is still moving along in pursuit of its original goal, with no plans to stop. We sincerely hope you join us as we continue to learn, grow, and create.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>My name's Ethan, and I'm the creative force behind Fawas Interactive. I'm a picky game enthusiast from the United States with a love of all things game development and a burning desire to make positive change in the industry.</p>
                <p>I'm very passionate about what I do, and Fawas gives me an outlet to share my love for things like Halloween, FPS games, the Source engine, camping, and everything spooky.</p>
                <p>When I'm not rambling to my friends about game development, I'm either obsessing over old zombie games, eating (my favorite), listening to rock music, or drawing.</p>

                <h3><strong><u>Quick Trivia</u></strong></h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Get to know Fawas Interactive further with some quick trivia!</p>
                <strong>Fawas The Sheep:</strong><br>You may have noticed the adorable sheep mascot scattered throughout our branding, we call him Fawas, short for "Fleece As White As Snow".<br><br>
                <strong>Clown Clear:</strong><br>Clown Clear is currently our most heavily developed project and has been steadily moving forward for a few years now. You can find out more at: <a href="https://www.clownclear.com/about.html">www.clownclear.com/about</a><br><br>
                <strong>First Game:</strong><br>Fawas' first ever game was called ‚ÄúBox Game‚Äù. It featured a player controller, a weird bean-stalk looking thing, and a big brick box accessible after some simple parkour. If you were lucky enough to make it through the 5 janky jumps using the movement system that I may or may not have stolen from a youtube tutorial, you'd hop in and find a sphere. That was probably really funny to me back then.
