            <!--<p>FawaStudios is an independent game developer and publisher based in the United States with a passion for creating all sorts of games. It was founded and currently operated by Ethan Fulmer (me), and I began by creating simple test projects in 2017 using the FawaStudios name.<br><br>In 2019, the concept of my main and largest project yet, Clown Clear, was created. Although over the years there have been several changes in vision and planning, I have stood by it and have been working on it since.<br><br>From the beginning of FawaStudios to current day, many projects have been worked on including a simple clicker game called Click Or Treat, and I have many plans for the future of game development and FawaStudios.</p>--->
