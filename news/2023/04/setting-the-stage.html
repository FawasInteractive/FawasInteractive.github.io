                    <p>Happy Easter for those who celebrate, and welcome back! This time for the third edition of the special edition weekly <em>Clown Clear</em> blog trilogy (aka a poor attempt at a marketing strategy). If you haven’t read the previous two about combat and game modes, you can do so here:<br><a href="https://www.fawasinteractive.com/news/2023/03/in-tents-combat">In-Tents Combat</a> | <a href="https://www.fawasinteractive.com/news/2023/04/game-modes-galore">Game Modes Galore</a></p>
<p>Today’s blog is all about level design, maps, and things otherwise related to the game’s campaigns.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">The Game’s Setting</h2>
<hr>
*Clown Clear* takes place shortly after the start of the **Corydon Morbus** outbreak, featuring multiple different states as the characters travel across the overtaken remains of the United States.

<p>Taking place near Halloween in the Autumn season, the world exhibits a creepily festive environment and a primarily warm color palette.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Design Philosophy</h2>
<hr>
Keeping this in mind, I’ve developed some general rules for myself to ensure the player is immersed when playing through the game’s maps. I won’t get too in detail about this for now, but here’s a few bullet points:

<ul>
<li><strong>Game Time</strong>: A lot of the maps will take place during the early morning or late at night, giving the game a creepy essence.</li>
<li><strong>Lighting</strong>: Lighting is very useful in making sure the player knows where they’re going, especially in the darker levels (e.g., flickering street lights).</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>: This is a pretty obvious one, but I’ve been trying to feature a wide variety of different locations and campaign events.</li>
<li><strong>Boundaries</strong>: The game is pretty linear, so having an exposed path somewhere leading to the empty void isn’t very adequate — neither is having invisible barriers everywhere. Therefore, using things such as crashed vehicles, fences, walls, etc., helps keep their presence justified and lore-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Panic Events</h2>
<hr>
Panic Events are different (mostly static) events that alert large hordes by themselves. These are typically used in finale levels and in varying areas of the campaigns. I haven’t decided whether or not I plan on having some of this be randomly chosen (like a panic event having 3 different areas it could activate), but it’s something I’ve been contemplating.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">AI Director</h2>
<hr>
Now, if you’ve played games with similar campaign modes such as *Left 4 Dead* or *Back 4 Blood*, you're probably familiar with the term “The Director”.

<p><em>Clown Clear</em> will feature a similar system since it’s really good at making sure each playthrough is different. Although I might end up calling it something fancy like “The Ringmaster” because it’s thematic to the whole clown thing.</p>
<p>There’s probably enough content there to dedicate its own blog post, but in short, I’m aiming for it to be very reminiscent of the above — featuring randomly chosen loot reserves, as well as dictating the spawns of bosses and common clowns, taking into account how well the player’s currently doing.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Progress Update</h2>
<hr>
Currently the maps are in very barebones states, but I do have most of the concepts fleshed out. Currently I’m focusing more on the actual gameplay mechanics before focusing all of my attention on level building.

<p>I might do a small-ish public playtest at some point with a single campaign, just so I can get more diverse feedback, but I’m not sure when I’ll go through with it. When I do though, you can be the first to know by following my Twitter, or joining the Discord.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
I ended up spending more time with my family than expected and had to rush through re-reading this, so there may be a few grammatical errors — regardless, I hope it was enjoyable.

<p>I’m also planning to reveal some more information on the game’s characters soon, so keep a look out for that.</p>
