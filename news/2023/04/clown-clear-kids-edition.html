                    <p>As all of you know, FawaStudios values family and morality more than anything. For this reason, we’re making the bold decision to completely scrap our progress on <em>Clown Clear</em>!</p>
<p>Now I know that sounds bad, but trust me — this is for the best! <em>Clown Clear</em> will continue to exist, but to collect as much money as possible, we’ve made the decision to rebuild everything from the ground up in a child-friendly, educational way.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Gameplay & Changes</h2>
<hr>
The previous version of *Clown Clear* was much too offensive, and we’ve carefully developed a plan to make sure we reach maximum accessibility while not ruining gameplay. To keep this blog post short (and definitely not haphazardly improvised within an hour), here are some of the main differences:

<ul>
<li><strong>PvE has been removed</strong>, instead replaced with a fun 6v6 PvP mode.</li>
<li><strong>No such thing as death!</strong> When a player is tagged, they will instead explode in a big beautiful cloud of confetti.</li>
<li><strong>Clown designs</strong> will now be much more lighthearted — instead of large, hulking mole hands, they’ll be equipped with fun little squirt guns.</li>
<li>To ensure those with a fear of clowns aren’t excluded, a button on the main menu can be clicked to change every clown-related feature into an image of a nice fluffy cat. Everybody loves cats!</li>
<li><strong>Apocalypse? Since when!</strong> <em>Clown Clear</em>’s story now takes place in an epic fantasy world where evil doesn’t exist.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Meet The Cast</h2>
<hr>
Now it’s time to show off our loveable little characters!

<p>Starting with the <strong>“Humans”</strong> team, there’s <strong>Gregory, Sarge, Noah, Jade, Charlotte, and Eddy</strong>. They’re essentially the same as before, but without the negative character traits, and much more friendly appearances!</p>
<p>As for the <strong>“Clowns”</strong> team, we have: <strong>Binko, Bongo, Bilbo, Beezo, Bubbles, and Ted</strong>. Each quietly seething with an insatiable desire to violently rip the flesh from their opponents&#39; faces, relishing in the warm splatter of blood and the sickening crunch of bones beneath their fingers, yet somehow managing to maintain a facade of civility and composure. This all-new, never-seen-before cast is a very friendly bunch!</p>
<p>And despite their tendencies to engage in goofy little competitions against one another, they love to intermingle and play fair.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Microtransactions & Monetization Plan</h2>
<hr>
Everybody knows you can’t have a children’s game without absolutely plastering it with ads and in-app purchases. So to take full advantage of the financially immature youth, we’ll feature a plethora of expensive & impractical transactions.

<p>One of the main sources of our revenue will be through <strong>“Clown Coins”</strong>. Starting at <strong>$9.99 a pop</strong>, players will use these to respawn once they’ve been kille—er, tagged, as well as buy one-time-use instant tags for other players, ensuring pay-to-win gameplay is forced in the event some sorry loser wishes to have <em>actual</em> fun.</p>
<p>We’re also implementing a massive catalog of goofy &amp; wacky &amp; silly little hats the player will be able to purchase and wear in-game. Don’t want to buy a hat? Sorry IDIOT — get off our game and go play something else. We might even add special perks to further incentivize bad spending habits.</p>
