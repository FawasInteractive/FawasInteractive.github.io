                    <p>Welcome back to another exciting, enticing, enthralling, very cool, awesome, unbearably epic FawaStudios blog post. Today I‚Äôll be giving some quick updates on <em>Click or Treat 2</em> and <em>Chimp Chowder</em> ‚Äî both of which I plan to release soon.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">FawaStudios</h2>
<hr>
I‚Äôm finally rolling out my new and improved FawaStudios Halloween branding. I know I‚Äôm a little late ‚Äî Spook Season starts on September 1st ‚Äî but as long as it‚Äôs before actual October, I‚Äôm happy.

<p>There have also been some minor changes to the FawaStudios website, which I plan on expanding more in the near future.</p>

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear</h2>
<hr>
Currently most of the work on *Clown Clear* is gathering reference images for the character sculpts and models. I‚Äôll also be working on maps more soon, but I‚Äôm taking a temporary break to focus on getting *Chimp Chowder* and *Click or Treat 2* out.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Chimp Chowder</h2>
<hr>
If you keep up with the Twitter page or the Discord server, you‚Äôll know that *Chimp Chowder* development is back in full swing (or half swing‚Ä¶ probably quarter swing ‚Äî either way, it‚Äôs in swing). 

<p>I‚Äôve been deciding on a new art style that remains relatively the same but with smoother edges, and optimization for the finalized chimp model is almost done.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/Blogs/FawasHalloweenAndMore/PolishedChimp.png" alt="Polished Chimp Model"></p>
<p>I still need to rewrite some scripts, make my new skin manager system, and possibly add powerups (something along those lines ‚Äî the game‚Äôs a little bland at the moment). Once that‚Äôs done, boom bada bing ‚Äî I am officially a certified Steam game developer.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Click or Treat 2</h2>
<hr>
Most of the work on *Click or Treat 2* so far has been backend optimizations and improving graphics and visual effects, but I‚Äôll start working heavily on the bigger mechanics like explorable buildings soon ‚Äî if I can make sure I‚Äôll have enough time.

<h3 class="blog-subpage-header">Building Problems</h3>
<p>
Currently I'm at a crossroads on how I want the buildings to work.
</p>

<p>My first idea was a (or multiple) front-facing room view(s) for each building ‚Äî kind of like the <em>Five Nights At Freddy‚Äôs</em> screens ‚Äî where you can click on certain objects in the view for whatever purpose I decide to give them.</p>
<p>The other idea is to just make a simple top-down movement system, and have each building be kind of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>-ish ‚Äî without all the hardcore RPG stuff. This might allow for a more advanced custom decoration system, more variation, and might be easier to implement overall.</p>
<p>If you have any opinions, feel free to give them to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/FawaStudios">Twitter</a> or my Discord server ‚Äî all feedback is helpful and appreciated!</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
Since this is my favorite season, I plan on doing a lot. Expect *Click or Treat 2* (once again, might just be an update) at the minimum ‚Äî but I really do want to get *Chimp Chowder* out before the end of October.

<p>Also, maybe look out for those <em>Clown Clear</em> character descriptions and more map information ‚Äî assuming multitasking doesn‚Äôt kill me.</p>
<p>Thank you, and buh-bye.</p>
