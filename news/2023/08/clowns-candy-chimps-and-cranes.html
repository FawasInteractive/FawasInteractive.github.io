                    <hr />

                    <p>Hello and welcome back to the official FawaStudios™ blog. It’s been a while once again, so I just want to give some information on the progress and plans for some of the games I’m working on — or planning to work on.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear</h2>
<hr>
Development for *Clown Clear* has been a bit chaotic, but I’m working on smoothing things out. I also want to be a little more strict with myself in the upcoming months so I can make as much progress as fast as possible. I've been addressing a few problems and plan to share more art-related content on my Discord, Twitter (or X 🤓), and this blog.

<p>Regarding the character reveals that I intended to post a while back, most of the work is complete — except for the rendered scenes, which proved to be a little overwhelming. However, with my recent surge of motivation, I&#39;m hoping to work on them in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>In recent news, my persistent search for a Hammer-esque level design tool has finally paid off after months of aggressive scouring on the internet. I discovered that the Source 2 Hammer editor has built-in export functionality, and after using it for a mere 30 minutes I realized that it was 100% the best tool I’ve used so far. This should make progress a lot faster in the level design department.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/Blogs/ClownsCandyChimpsCranes/GregsHouseSource2.png" alt="WIP House in HL:A Hammer"><br><em>(Image of a W.I.P house in HL:A Hammer — obviously not permanent models since I’d be sued into oblivion)</em></p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Click or Treat 2</h2>
<hr>
I’m still not sure whether to call this an update or a sequel, but I’ve started development on it with the latest *Click or Treat* update as a base. This has been pretty slow, but I’m planning on having it out by Halloween, and increasing development time as that deadline gets closer.

<p>Content-wise, I’m working on getting things that I failed to add to the previous updates into this one, as well as some cool new mechanics. Here’s a list of the most notable additions, which may or may not be cut or altered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player House(s)</strong> – Interactable items, maybe even purchasable decorations?</li>
<li><strong>Costumes</strong> – Serves as upgrades, mix &amp; match perks?</li>
<li><strong>Devil Deals</strong> – Permanent upgrades, uses souls</li>
<li><strong>Random Buildings</strong> – Explorable, slightly procedural, obtainable loot?</li>
<li><strong>More Variety</strong> – Random houses with more variety in doors, outside decorations, etc.</li>
<li><strong>World / Lore</strong> – Viewable world progression as monsters become more prominent?</li>
<li><strong>Achievements</strong> – This is surprisingly difficult</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll try to go more in depth on these changes later on and get feedback — but these are just some things I’m conceptualizing.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Chimp Chowder</h2>
<hr>
![Chimp Chowder Neglect Meme](../../../images/Blogs/ClownsCandyChimpsCranes/ChimpChowderNeglect.png)

<p>Currently <em>Chimp Chowder</em>, the beloved chowder-feeding chimp simulator seen in the meme above, has been navigating its way through the treacherous depths of development hell. While this is undeniably tragic, it’s temporary — and I haven’t completely abandoned it yet. I’m still focusing most of my efforts on <em>Clown Clear</em>, but hopefully sometime soon I’ll work on finally getting it out there.</p>
<p>For transparency’s sake, here’s a list of things I need to do before I can launch the game on Steam and Itch.io, preferably right after the pages go public:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skin System</strong> – Need to rewrite the skin system so I can easily add new skins while giving players a sense of achievement. This has given me trouble in the past, but it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Level Design</strong> – The map is properly scaled, but I still need to add various props and fix up some messy looking textures.</li>
<li><strong>Toon Shader?</strong> – This one has been giving me a lot of problems, and I’m still not entirely sure if it’s the right thing to do. It’ll be the most time-consuming part, but I think it’ll really pay off.</li>
<li><strong>Model Polish</strong> – To have a skin system, I need to work on polishing the current chimp model. Currently, the UVs, topology, etc., are suboptimal, and I’d like to fix those up before release.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game might release in early access so I can add new modes and features based on community feedback — but it’ll definitely be in a playable state. With the skin system, I’ll also try to have regular-ish updates with new skins to unlock.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Mr. Crane</h2>
<hr>
*Mr. Crane* is a Halloween game I planned on making with a strict deadline, right around my introduction to Unreal Engine 5. Predictably, this didn’t go as well as I expected, and I had to cancel it. Now that I’m more experienced with the engine, I’d like to revisit it — possibly in time for Halloween this year — assuming *Click or Treat 2*, or life, doesn’t get in the way.

<p>I might change the style to be 2D rather than 3D though. I can always have a 3D sequel if I ever feel like it — lol. As a wise man once said, “I would rather have a finished 2D game than an unfinished 3D game.” That wise man… was me.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
And that concludes today's news. I’ll make an effort to get more blog posts out on various *Clown Clear* topics as well as miscellaneous updates soon. But for now, I hope this glimpse of FawaStudios™ (is this joke getting stale yet?) insider information was valuable in some way.

<p>Bye bye! Follow my Twitter, join my Discord, admire my new “News” page, and take care!</p>
