                    <p>
                        Good afternoon my friends. Today‚Äôs blog will be mostly focused on the miscellaneous improvements I‚Äôve been working on, both on the Clown Clear &amp; FawaStudios sides of things.
                        <br><br>
                        Quick apologies for ravaging the upload schedule, I‚Äôll definitely try to improve on that, but for now it might be a little hectic. And I‚Äôd also like to quickly wish everyone a very late happy New Years, and I hope 2023 will be a good year for all of us.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Website Renovation</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        First thing on the agenda, the website renovation. Currently, the FawaStudios website is a bit broken on mobile, slightly outdated, doesn‚Äôt look particularly appealing, and it‚Äôs kind of difficult to modify. Not to mention that the Clown Clear page looks as if it were designed in a total of 5 minutes (it was actually 10).
                        <br><br>
                        Now that I‚Äôm done slandering my hard work, I can comfortably confirm that I‚Äôm working on a full-site renovation, which aims to fix all the problems above as well as improve on various other aspects. I‚Äôd also like to put forth an effort to give Clown Clear the same treatment.
                        <br><br>
                        When will this be done? I‚Äôm not exactly sure, but I think a week or two might be a decent estimation, take that with a grain of salt though as there‚Äôs a lot that needs to be done.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Discord Renovation</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Throughout it‚Äôs lifetime, my Discord server has received multiple ‚Äúrenovations‚Äù, but I‚Äôm still not particularly satisfied with it. This may just stay a long-term goal for a while, but I *would* like to tidy up a little before going all out on my advertising.
                        <br><br>
                        Currently it‚Äôs kind of a mess, since there‚Äôs not really an official ‚Äúrule-set‚Äù or ‚Äúguide‚Äù, I contribute to the chaos by doing (most) things on impulse. Randomly adding new emotes I find funny; adding, removing, or modifying channels on a spur; etc. Not exactly practical.
                        <br><br>
                        The big ‚Äúrenovation‚Äù will probably happen within the span of a few days, whenever it is I actually go through with it. This *will* include pre-planning &amp; announcements though, so it won‚Äôt just come randomly.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear Marketing</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Currently I‚Äôve come up with an estimated deadline for Clown Clear‚Äôs release, which I think works out as it‚Äôs both practical and convenient. I‚Äôm still going to refrain from revealing that for a while though, since it‚Äôs still just a rough estimation and I don‚Äôt want to have to ‚Äúdelay‚Äù the game.
                        <br><br>
                        For now, I plan on posting a lot more frequently on both the FawaStudios and Clown Clear Twitter accounts, both with news / teasers along with the random PR stuff. Speaking of which, I‚Äôve also made a new logo for Clown Clear, visible below:
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        That‚Äôs all I could muster up for today. If you‚Äôd like to join my <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe">Discord server</a> or check out the Twitter pages (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=FawasInteract">FawaStudios</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownClearGame">Clown Clear</a>), you can do so by clicking on any of those words. Thank you for reading, and I‚Äôll be back in about a week, possibly.
