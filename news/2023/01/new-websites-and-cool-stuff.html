                    <hr />

                    <p>Good afternoon my friends. Today‚Äôs blog will be mostly focused on the miscellaneous improvements I‚Äôve been working on, both on the <em>Clown Clear</em> and <em>FawaStudios</em> sides of things.</p>
<p>Quick apologies for ravaging the upload schedule ‚Äî I‚Äôll definitely try to improve on that, but for now it might be a little hectic. And I‚Äôd also like to quickly wish everyone a very late happy New Year, and I hope 2023 will be a good year for all of us.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Website Renovation</h2>
<hr>
First thing on the agenda, the website renovation. Currently, the FawaStudios website is a bit broken on mobile, slightly outdated, doesn‚Äôt look particularly appealing, and it‚Äôs kind of difficult to modify. Not to mention that the *Clown Clear* page looks as if it were designed in a total of 5 minutes (it was actually 10).

<p>Now that I‚Äôm done slandering my hard work, I can comfortably confirm that I‚Äôm working on a full-site renovation, which aims to fix all the problems above as well as improve on various other aspects. I‚Äôd also like to put forth an effort to give <em>Clown Clear</em> the same treatment.</p>
<p>When will this be done? I‚Äôm not exactly sure, but I think a week or two might be a decent estimation ‚Äî take that with a grain of salt though, as there‚Äôs a lot that needs to be done.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Discord Renovation</h2>
<hr>
Throughout its lifetime, my Discord server has received multiple ‚Äúrenovations‚Äù, but I‚Äôm still not particularly satisfied with it. This may just stay a long-term goal for a while, but I *would* like to tidy up a little before going all out on my advertising.

<p>Currently it‚Äôs kind of a mess, since there‚Äôs not really an official ‚Äúrule-set‚Äù or ‚Äúguide‚Äù. I contribute to the chaos by doing (most) things on impulse ‚Äî randomly adding new emotes I find funny; adding, removing, or modifying channels on a spur; etc. Not exactly practical.</p>
<p>The big ‚Äúrenovation‚Äù will probably happen within the span of a few days, whenever it is I actually go through with it. This <em>will</em> include pre-planning and announcements though, so it won‚Äôt just come randomly.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear Marketing</h2>
<hr>
Currently I‚Äôve come up with an estimated deadline for *Clown Clear*‚Äôs release, which I think works out as it‚Äôs both practical and convenient. I‚Äôm still going to refrain from revealing that for a while though, since it‚Äôs still just a rough estimation and I don‚Äôt want to have to ‚Äúdelay‚Äù the game.

<p>For now, I plan on posting a lot more frequently on both the FawaStudios and <em>Clown Clear</em> Twitter accounts, both with news, teasers, and random PR stuff. Speaking of which, I‚Äôve also made a new logo for <em>Clown Clear</em>, visible below:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/Games/ClownClear/ClownClear_Icon.png" alt="Clown Clear Logo"></p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
That‚Äôs all I could muster up for today. If you‚Äôd like to join my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe ), or check out the Twitter pages ([FawaStudios](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=FawasInteract ) & [Clown Clear](https://twitter.com/ClownClearGame )), you can do so by clicking on any of those words.

<p>Thank you for reading, and I‚Äôll be back in about a week, possibly.</p>
