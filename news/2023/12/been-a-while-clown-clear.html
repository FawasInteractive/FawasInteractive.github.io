                    <p>Hey all, quick blog post to give a quick progress update. Probably nothing insanely new to anyone who&#39;s been in the Discord server for a while ‚Äî and a little ramble-y ‚Äî but I haven‚Äôt written one of these in a while, and I thought I might as well.</p>
<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Recent Progress</h4>
<hr>
To begin, I'm still actively working on *Clown Clear*. Been ironing out the core systems for the inventory, interaction, and pickup systems. Actually making some good progress ‚Äî so hopefully I can move onto the more fun mechanics like actual weapon mechanics. Kind of sucks that I've spent so much time on this, but I've been trying to make it as polished as possible so I won't have to redo anything or spend more time on it in the future.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Current Plans</h4>
<hr>
I've had some issues with gaining motivation, but I'm trying to snap out of that ‚Äî and hopefully the aforementioned cool stuff I'll be working on will help with that. My current plan is to push out a very simple gameplay video with only the very basic stuff. That way, I can publish my Steam page and start doing other marketing-adjacent things.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Trailer Stuff</h4>
<hr>
The trailer will hopefully include some basic clown AI (nothing intense), probably a barebones spawning system, and no special infected just yet ‚Äî but something you can shoot at, with hopefully decent models. A few weapons and items ‚Äî like the medkit, a pistol, maybe a few primary ranged weapons ‚Äî just to show off the inventory system and simple gunplay mechanics. Nothing outstanding, but again, it‚Äôs mostly just a prerequisite to breaking the silence and showing people what‚Äôs coming.

<p>No melee weapons yet ‚Äî I plan on having fairly complicated logic for them, and I&#39;d prefer to take my time on that first. Some other miscellaneous things to include: a basic map segment, the bash attack, and maybe a molotov ‚Äî just simple things like that.</p>
<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Post-Trailer</h4>
<hr>
After that, like I said, I'd like to maybe start doing more community-involved development things ‚Äî like streaming development sessions on Twitch. Obviously going to be posting more footage on Twitter, Discord, wherever else I decide is worth my time.

<p>Might also start a Kickstarter, but that‚Äôd probably come later ‚Äî I want to have a solid base first. Once I start taking people&#39;s money, it becomes an issue of &quot;Well, don‚Äôt want to look like a scammer,&quot; and that‚Äôs just a little too stressful for me.</p>
<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Failed Conclusion</h4>
<hr>
Don‚Äôt want to make this too long ‚Äî I‚Äôve covered pretty much everything I really needed to. Wrote it all sporadically without any bullet points or planning, so let me know on Discord or via email if there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôd like me to expand on or clarify in a future post.

<p><em>Clown Clear</em> is still on track for a <strong>Halloween 2024</strong> release ‚Äî whether or not that changes is beyond me, but I&#39;m aiming for around there. I plan on releasing those character bios finally on <strong>January 5th, 2024</strong>, which I mentioned on Discord. Yeah, for once I paid someone to do work for me, so I don‚Äôt have to rely on my horrible schedule to push that out ‚Äî hopefully that‚Äôll be cool to see.</p>
<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion Pt. 2</h4>
<hr>
Rambling again, so I‚Äôll end it here. I appreciate everyone who shows even the slightest interest in the project. I‚Äôm very passionate about it, and I know I‚Äôve been slow ‚Äî but I‚Äôm always improving, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.

<p>BUT ‚Äî I&#39;m trying my best.</p>
<p>Have a good day / night / morning readers. See you in the next one!</p>
