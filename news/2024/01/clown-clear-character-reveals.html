                            <p>Age: 26<br />Hometown: Columbus, Ohio</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p class="char-blog-subpage-description">
                                Following in his father's footsteps, Noah had always been interested in the medical field, planning to pursue it himself from a very young age.
                                <br /><br />
                                A week before his graduation at medical school, society as he knew it collapsed-leaving him to watch as hordes of the infected turn his once-bustling city into a twisted anatomy lesson. Armed with a scalpel and a prescription for survival: he vowed to cure the world one clown at a time.

                            <p>Age: 25<br />Hometown: Unknown</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>
                                Although not extremely successful in finding love or good work, Jade has a seemingly magnetic personality. Her witty jokes, unique ideas, and kindness finds her many friends. Just not many lifelong companions.
                                <br /><br />
                                After a long day of hanging with her favorite co-workers, the unthinkable happened-Ralphie Lucciano, a man she'd found herself increasingly attached to, invited her to his house. As her friends wooed the two away, she felt like the cards had finally been stacked in her favor.
                                <br /><br />
                                Alas, things quickly began falling apart as he began hurling on her favorite shirt and convulsing violently. Upon dialing 911 and glancing out the window, she'd realize this wasn't an isolated event: the world as she knew it was over, and if she wasn't careful her love life wouldn't be the only thing dead-on-arrival.

                            <p>Age: 35<br />Hometown: ???, Kentucky</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>
                                Charlotte was a harsh but lovable school teacher, considered among the best in the county. Her straightforward and no-nonsense approach scared away most adults, but kept her students in line. Despite having no kids of her own, she often "joked" about wanting six.
                                <br /><br />
                                While teaching middle schoolers how to write essays might've been a viable way of life before the apocalypse, she's forced to go off curriculum and teach these polka-dotted-freaks a lesson or two in a different subject.

                            <hr />
                            <p>
                                With a decade behind the wheel as a seasoned truck driver, and having experienced his fair share of road rage (including physical altercations), Sarge has always been known for his rough & tough demeanor. Whenever his family needed a job done, especially his sister, Sarge was the go-to-guy.
                                <br /><br />
                                Following an especially disheartening call, Sarge found himself scraping the remains of what was once his brother-in-law off his jacket, realizing the road ahead would have more to offer than petty tailgaters and bird-flipping.

                            <hr />
                            <p>
                                As an ex-paper salesman, Eddy has an almost supernatural ability to convince people of things. Upon getting rich from his late uncle's inheritance, he bought a boat and planned on staying unemployed while managing his money.
                                <br /><br />
                                Unfortunately for him, killer clowns aren't so easily persuaded, and money is of little value in the apocalypse. On the bright side, he still knows his way around the sea... and a gun.

                            <hr />
                            <p>
                                Given the strange nickname, "Gregward" by both his friends and family, Gregory is often playfully teased and considered an oddball. Despite his questionable social life, he's a baker and a family man, loving his wife and children more than anything else in the world.
                                <br /><br />
                                Now that the apocalypse has taken it all away, he's determined to try out his latest recipe-one of carnage and retribution.
