                    <p>After a lot of consideration, I’ve decided to change our name from <strong>“FawaStudios”</strong> to <strong>“Fawas Interactive”</strong>. There are a decent amount of reasons for this — here are some of the main points.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Double S’s:</strong> The S in “FawaS” + “Studios” reads as “Fawa” + “Studios”, and “Fawas Studios” would’ve still required a lot of rebranding (plus it’s still a little misleading for the same reason as the next point)</li>

  <li><strong>Studios Suffix:</strong> “Studios” feels disingenuous considering there is only one “employee”, and obviously there aren’t multiple studios around the world. While the plan is for that to change <em>eventually</em>, it’s still not the case <em>now</em>.</li>

  <li><strong>Interactive Suffix:</strong> “Interactive” seems to work well considering I mostly produce interactive video games, but I’m still planning on working on non-game-related ventures (like plain software down the line), which the suffix logically encompasses.</li>

  <li><strong>Simple Transition:</strong> “Fawas Interactive” didn’t have many search results nor was it unavailable as a username on many social media websites, which means I was able to smoothly transition into the new name without having to spend years optimizing search results or using names like “@RealFawasInt123”.</li>

  <li><strong>The Future:</strong> As mentioned earlier, I think having FawaStudios separated into two words — “Fawas” and “Interactive” — is better long-term. People can potentially shorten it to just “Fawas”, and eventually if the company is registered as a corporation, both names “Fawas Interactive” and “Fawas Corporation” can be used.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The social medias and website have already been updated to reflect this. I still own the domain “<a href="https://www.fawastudios.com/">fawastudios.com</a>” and plan to have it redirect to the new “<a href="https://www.fawasinteractive.com/">fawasinteractive.com</a>” website, but I’ve encountered some strange technical issues that need to be resolved before that’s possible.</p>

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">FawasVoxels Project</h4>
<hr>
![FawasVoxels Logo](/images/Blogs/FawasInteractiveAndGameUpdates/FawasVoxelsLogo.png)

<p>If you’ve been paying attention to my Discord server or YouTube channel (every other outlet has been temporarily abandoned), then you’ll know about a recent project I’ve been working on — temporarily (or permanently, not sure yet) dubbed <strong>“FawasVoxels”</strong>.</p>
<p>This is my take on a voxel-based open-world survival game, which would likely be a mix between <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Terraria</em>, focusing on giving the player a lot of creative liberty through things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating pixel-art paintings that can be hung up  </li>
<li>Mixing dozens of food types to create custom recipes  </li>
<li>Having every (or most) items placeable in the world</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this might not be implemented, as this is currently just being experimented with — but if I do continue with it, this is the basic “vision”.</p>
<p>Whether or not it will be canceled or put on the back-burner has yet to be seen. But I’ve had many personal issues with how development has been handled on similar games, and I’ve always wanted to try creating my own — as an actual optimized, flexible project rather than a one-off coding challenge.</p>
<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear</h4>

<p>Clown Clear development was halted for a bit due to burnout, but while sleeping I did what most good developers do: opened my eyes violently and decided to get up exclusively to work on the game.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s due to some undiagnosed mental illness, or perhaps this is just a magical side effect of game development — but I proceeded to get a decent amount of work done and polished a system that had been worked on for a good while, with absolutely zero interference from my brain telling me to give up.</p>
<p>The current plan is to do as much as possible in as short a time as possible. Right now I&#39;m working on improving the animation system, but I really need to hustle so I can finally release the Steam page and possibly release a demo. I&#39;ve also been in talks with people to help produce assets — so hopefully that will speed some things up or open up more possibilities faster.</p>
<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h4>
<hr>
That’s all for now — hopefully there will be a lot more to come soon. Might try to force myself to start making more blog posts, definitely with intervals less than 4 months at a time 😅
