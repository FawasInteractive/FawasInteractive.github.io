                    Hello again! As you all may know, the holiday season is upon us, which means it's time for more thematic branding and deafening- err, delightful Christmas music. If you've visited the Twitter or Discord recently, you may have already noticed a few of the changes, along with the beautiful red elf-sheep icon. If you haven't, you can do so by going to these two links! (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/FawaStudios">Twitter</a>) (<a href="https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe">Discord</a>) (Thanks).
                    <br></br>
                    Shameless plug out of the way, this week I've been doing a lot of organization-based work on both the website and a new wiki-styled Clown Clear document, not to mention some notable (and unfortunately confidential) clown variant changes.
                </p>

                <h2>Business Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    Starting off with the more general FawaStudios-related changes, I've finally pushed out the new text-based logo, currently visible within this holiday-themed Twitter banner:
                </p>

                <img src="../../../images/Blogs/SprucingThingsUp/Fawas_Winter_Banner.jpg" class="game-img" style="margin-top: -5px; width: 70%; height: auto;">

                <p>
                    I'm currently pleased with how it looks, but if anyone has any suggestions feel free to let me know on Twitter, Discord, or through my email (<a href="mailto: fawastudios@gmail.com">fawastudios@gmail.com</a>).
                    <br><br>
                    I've also added a temporary "News" tab to the website. I still have plans to create a cleaner page, but currently it does it‚Äôs job and allows me to produce these blog posts early without the added headache of having to struggle with CSS for three consecutive months.
                </p>

                <h2>Clown Clear Organization</h2>

                <p>
                    Let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room (or rather, my room)‚ÄîI‚Äôm not great at organization, in fact my typical setup involves a desktop with thirty scattered notepad files, fifteen Google Docs documents, a notebook with extremely inconsistent page structure, and a handful of deserted Trello boards.
                    <br><br>
                    Obviously this is an exaggeration, but my point still stands. The good news, however, is that I‚Äôve discovered a wonderful website known as ‚ÄúNotion‚Äù (I‚Äôm not sponsored or anything, just very passionate). After spending a brief amount of time investigating, I made the decision to create a huge wiki-styled document containing all of the features in one neat, organized place. This time making the decision to stick with it rather than creating a newer, more organized version and getting caught in an endless cycle.
                    <br><br>
                    This isn‚Äôt something that was absolutely needed, as my previous method technically ‚Äúworked‚Äù, but this is definitely helpful in keeping all of my thoughts organized and tweaking things accordingly. If anyone ever needs to organize a big project, or even create a basic to-do list for your daily routine, I recommend giving <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> a try.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                    To account for this being a shorter-than-usual post, I‚Äôll offer a limited edition, very context-appropriate clown joke, which also serves as a very slight and unintentional spoiler.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"<b>Why don‚Äôt cannibals eat clowns?</b> Because they taste funny.‚Äù</i>
                    <br><br>
