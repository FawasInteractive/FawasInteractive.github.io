                    <p>Salutations, and welcome once again to the official FawaStudios‚Ñ¢ blog, where only the most exciting and thought-provoking information is revealed. Now, if you‚Äôre an avid viewer, I thoroughly apologize for missing the deadline last night ‚Äî I hit a creative roadblock and had no clue what to write about.</p>
<p>After some deep recollecting, there‚Äôs still a few things I can cover. So without further ado, here we go.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Unreal Engine Updates</h2>

<p>If you follow other game development or industry news, you might already know about the newest update to the Unreal Engine ‚Äî version 5.1. I could ramble for hours about how enthralled I am with these changes, but to keep this section relatively short, I‚Äôll just summarize it with this inspirational quote:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Blogs/FawasAndTheNearFuture/Joke_Quote.png" alt="Joke Quote"></p>
<p>And since <em>Clown Clear</em> is still a ways off, I went ahead and downloaded this massive update, sacrificing what little stability my internet had left. This has a lot of benefits, but most notably are the lighting improvements and a huge performance boost for foliage.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Where‚Äôs The Clown Clear Website?</h2>

<p>As some of you may know, I own both the <a href="https://www.fawasinteractive.com/">fawastudios.com</a> and <a href="https://www.clownclear.com/">clownclear.com</a> domains, but currently the <em>Clown Clear</em> website has yet to receive the care and attention that I‚Äôve so thoughtfully provided with FawaStudios.</p>
<p>It will probably have to stay that way for a while, but as part of my slow-but-sure renovation plan, I‚Äôm going to take up the task of reorganizing the sub-pages on the main website in the near future. That means you‚Äôll finally be able to check out the game‚Äôs Q&amp;A without having to search through my Discord server. <strong>(Still join though plz &lt;3)</strong></p>
<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>

<p>News has been kind of dry recently, but I‚Äôm still trying my best to keep the wheel turning. As always, I sincerely appreciate those who‚Äôve taken the time to read through these posts, so I‚Äôm hiding this free Steam key for <em>Just Cause 3</em>:<br><strong><code>A3RAE-XGA26-359J7</code></strong></p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t already, you can join the official FawaStudios Discord server with this link:<br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe">https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe </a><br>Hoping to see you there!</p>
