Welcome back to another exciting, enticing, enthralling, very cool, awesome, unbearably epic FawaStudios blog post. Today I’ll be giving some quick updates on *Click or Treat 2* and *Chimp Chowder* — both of which I plan to release soon.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">FawaStudios</h2>
<hr>
I’m finally rolling out my new and improved FawaStudios Halloween branding. I know I’m a little late — Spook Season starts on September 1st — but as long as it’s before actual October, I’m happy.

There have also been some minor changes to the FawaStudios website, which I plan on expanding more in the near future.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear</h2>
<hr>
Currently most of the work on *Clown Clear* is gathering reference images for the character sculpts and models. I’ll also be working on maps more soon, but I’m taking a temporary break to focus on getting *Chimp Chowder* and *Click or Treat 2* out.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Chimp Chowder</h2>
<hr>
If you keep up with the Twitter page or the Discord server, you’ll know that *Chimp Chowder* development is back in full swing (or half swing… probably quarter swing — either way, it’s in swing). 

I’ve been deciding on a new art style that remains relatively the same but with smoother edges, and optimization for the finalized chimp model is almost done.

I still need to rewrite some scripts, make my new skin manager system, and possibly add powerups (something along those lines — the game’s a little bland at the moment). Once that’s done, boom bada bing — I am officially a certified Steam game developer.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Click or Treat 2</h2>
<hr>
Most of the work on *Click or Treat 2* so far has been backend optimizations and improving graphics and visual effects, but I’ll start working heavily on the bigger mechanics like explorable buildings soon — if I can make sure I’ll have enough time.

<h3 class="blog-subpage-header">Building Problems</h3>
<p>
Currently I'm at a crossroads on how I want the buildings to work.
</p>

My first idea was a (or multiple) front-facing room view(s) for each building — kind of like the *Five Nights At Freddy’s* screens — where you can click on certain objects in the view for whatever purpose I decide to give them.

The other idea is to just make a simple top-down movement system, and have each building be kind of *The Binding of Isaac*-ish — without all the hardcore RPG stuff. This might allow for a more advanced custom decoration system, more variation, and might be easier to implement overall.

If you have any opinions, feel free to give them to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FawaStudios ) or my Discord server — all feedback is helpful and appreciated!

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
Since this is my favorite season, I plan on doing a lot. Expect *Click or Treat 2* (once again, might just be an update) at the minimum — but I really do want to get *Chimp Chowder* out before the end of October.

Also, maybe look out for those *Clown Clear* character descriptions and more map information — assuming multitasking doesn’t kill me.

Thank you, and buh-bye.
