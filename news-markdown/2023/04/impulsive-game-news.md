Today I’d like to give some information on my plans for my various games, as well as some general information on what I’ve been working on.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">FawaStudios</h2>
<hr>
Currently there’s not much to speak about in regards to FawaStudios itself. For now I’m mostly happy with the Discord server and the website. I do want to redesign the “News” page at some point though — since the stack of grotesquely highlighted text gets less and less bearable with every new blog — but I’m not sure when I’ll do that.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear</h2>
<hr>
On the *Clown Clear* side of things, I’m currently writing descriptions for the characters which I’ll include in a future blog. I’ve also been continuing to work on the campaigns and special infected, but I want to hold off from revealing much of that since it could easily change.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Other Projects</h2>
<hr>
Aside from *Clown Clear*, I’ve been working a little on some other projects. The timeline for this will be a little random, but I’d like to go back and work on updating or releasing my other games.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Concession Obsession</h4>
The *Concession Obsession* update is planned to be pretty small, but it’d polish a lot of things up, add sounds, fix the absurdity of the concession stand spawning mechanics, and possibly add extra stuff like a simple skin system.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Click or Treat</h4>
The *Click or Treat* update might end up being a new game entirely, but I feel like that’d be a little unnecessary. I’d likely remake the entire game, release it as an update, and then keep the old version available elsewhere for anyone who’d like to play it.

This update would include new graphics, the previous mechanics, and feature things from an abandoned update a while ago (such as statistics, achievements, etc.).

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Mr. Crane</h4>
*Mr. Crane* was canceled because I didn’t manage my time well (I spent the entirety of one of my days on a lantern model), so I plan on remaking it at some point, as well as giving myself more time to work on it. The features will be mostly the same, but I’ll probably fix some plot holes and other minor issues — I might even include some in-depth lore too.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Chimp Chowder</h4>
*Chimp Chowder* was announced about a year ago, and there were a lot of complications which quickly vanquished every remaining piece of my soul. Luckily, however, my skills have improved to a point where I’m confident I can release it relatively soon. The first “official” announcement will probably arrive alongside a “coming soon” Steam page, and then the game will actually release shortly after.

As for the content, the game will probably have the skin system and graphics which caused a ton of headaches in the past, but everything else will be essentially the same. I still plan on releasing updates with new skins, gamemodes(?), etc.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
Just wanted to quickly write this because there hasn’t been much news since the last blog post. I would like to try to get most (if not all) of this done within 2023, but *Clown Clear* is still my primary focus at the moment. Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe ) if you want — because it’s sad and empty — and I like seeing numbers rise.
