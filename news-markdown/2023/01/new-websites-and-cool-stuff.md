Good afternoon my friends. Today’s blog will be mostly focused on the miscellaneous improvements I’ve been working on, both on the *Clown Clear* and *FawaStudios* sides of things.

Quick apologies for ravaging the upload schedule — I’ll definitely try to improve on that, but for now it might be a little hectic. And I’d also like to quickly wish everyone a very late happy New Year, and I hope 2023 will be a good year for all of us.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Website Renovation</h2>
<hr>
First thing on the agenda, the website renovation. Currently, the FawaStudios website is a bit broken on mobile, slightly outdated, doesn’t look particularly appealing, and it’s kind of difficult to modify. Not to mention that the *Clown Clear* page looks as if it were designed in a total of 5 minutes (it was actually 10).

Now that I’m done slandering my hard work, I can comfortably confirm that I’m working on a full-site renovation, which aims to fix all the problems above as well as improve on various other aspects. I’d also like to put forth an effort to give *Clown Clear* the same treatment.

When will this be done? I’m not exactly sure, but I think a week or two might be a decent estimation — take that with a grain of salt though, as there’s a lot that needs to be done.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Discord Renovation</h2>
<hr>
Throughout its lifetime, my Discord server has received multiple “renovations”, but I’m still not particularly satisfied with it. This may just stay a long-term goal for a while, but I *would* like to tidy up a little before going all out on my advertising.

Currently it’s kind of a mess, since there’s not really an official “rule-set” or “guide”. I contribute to the chaos by doing (most) things on impulse — randomly adding new emotes I find funny; adding, removing, or modifying channels on a spur; etc. Not exactly practical.

The big “renovation” will probably happen within the span of a few days, whenever it is I actually go through with it. This *will* include pre-planning and announcements though, so it won’t just come randomly.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Clown Clear Marketing</h2>
<hr>
Currently I’ve come up with an estimated deadline for *Clown Clear*’s release, which I think works out as it’s both practical and convenient. I’m still going to refrain from revealing that for a while though, since it’s still just a rough estimation and I don’t want to have to “delay” the game.

For now, I plan on posting a lot more frequently on both the FawaStudios and *Clown Clear* Twitter accounts, both with news, teasers, and random PR stuff. Speaking of which, I’ve also made a new logo for *Clown Clear*, visible below:

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
That’s all I could muster up for today. If you’d like to join my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BGg7pRxaUe ), or check out the Twitter pages ([FawaStudios](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=FawasInteract ) & [Clown Clear](https://twitter.com/ClownClearGame )), you can do so by clicking on any of those words.

Thank you for reading, and I’ll be back in about a week, possibly.
