Welcome to yet another edition of the FawaStudios™ blog, where only the most insightful and jaw-dropping collections of words are found. I made a poll about which *Clown Clear* topic I should cover first, and the “Item & Inventory” system came out victorious. If you’d like to participate in future polls, make sure to check out my Twitter page at [twitter.com/FawaStudios](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=FawasInteract ).

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">The Inventory System</h2>
<hr>
There are a variety of items the player can use in *Clown Clear*, whether for defense, healing, etc. These are categorized into 5 slots:
- A primary firearm  
- A primary melee weapon  
- A secondary weapon (whether it be a small melee weapon or a small firearm)  
- A throwable item  
- A healing item  

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">The Combat System</h2>
<hr>
The combat system will be pretty straightforward, featuring a wide array of weapons for use in both long-range and close-range situations. It’s planned to be smoothly incorporated with the gore and damage system I have in mind, hopefully ensuring enjoyable clown slaughtering for the long term.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Ranged Combat</h4>
While the majority of ranged weapons are expected to be guns, there may be a few unique weapons included as well. Firearms will utilize a variety of mechanics, including aim down sights, bullet piercing, and standard mechanics commonly found in other FPS games.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Melee Combat</h4>
The melee system will be pretty straightforward, featuring a few different swinging animations in sequence that accurately represent the collision between it and the enemies.

I’ve also been considering the idea of control-based attacks — so moving your mouse down while performing an attack could do an overhead swing. Whether this will be in the game is still undecided, but I think it could add a lot more variety in how you fight.

<h4 class="blog-subpage-header">Shove / Weapon Bash</h4>
That stuff is cool and all, but you know what’s really fun? Clocking someone upside the head with a pistol, or shoving them off the Empire State Building (in the game, of course).

Assuming there are no really wonky side effects I have yet to discover, I’m hoping to develop a smooth weapon bash system. Aside from my personal love for shoving game characters (namely in *Grand Theft Auto* and *Left 4 Dead*), this will be very helpful when trying to escape the large hordes, as well as providing a cool extra layer of defense.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
That’s all for this update. Hopefully soon I’ll be posting some clips of the combat (an early version of course) in action. I’m also going to be posting two more *Clown Clear*-related blog posts in the coming weeks, so look forward to those.

Thanks for reading, and see you in next week’s update!
