Salutations, and welcome once again to the official FawaStudios™ blog, where only the most exciting and thought-provoking information is revealed. Now, if you’re an avid viewer, I thoroughly apologize for missing the deadline last night — I hit a creative roadblock and had no clue what to write about.

After some deep recollecting, there’s still a few things I can cover. So without further ado, here we go.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Unreal Engine Updates</h2>

If you follow other game development or industry news, you might already know about the newest update to the Unreal Engine — version 5.1. I could ramble for hours about how enthralled I am with these changes, but to keep this section relatively short, I’ll just summarize it with this inspirational quote:

And since *Clown Clear* is still a ways off, I went ahead and downloaded this massive update, sacrificing what little stability my internet had left. This has a lot of benefits, but most notably are the lighting improvements and a huge performance boost for foliage.

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Where’s The Clown Clear Website?</h2>

As some of you may know, I own both the [fawastudios.com](https://www.fawasinteractive.com/ ) and [clownclear.com](https://www.clownclear.com/ ) domains, but currently the *Clown Clear* website has yet to receive the care and attention that I’ve so thoughtfully provided with FawaStudios.

It will probably have to stay that way for a while, but as part of my slow-but-sure renovation plan, I’m going to take up the task of reorganizing the sub-pages on the main website in the near future. That means you’ll finally be able to check out the game’s Q&A without having to search through my Discord server. **(Still join though plz <3)**

<h2 class="blog-subpage-header">Conclusion</h2>

News has been kind of dry recently, but I’m still trying my best to keep the wheel turning. As always, I sincerely appreciate those who’ve taken the time to read through these posts, so I’m hiding this free Steam key for *Just Cause 3*:  
**`A3RAE-XGA26-359J7`**
